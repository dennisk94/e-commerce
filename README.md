## Overview

The inspiration for the Shoe Depot app stemmed from wanting to find a framework that would allow me to add meta data without utilizing a third party library. From there, I delved much deeper into the amazing capabilities of Next.js which eventually led to a full-fledged application. This was my first time working with a backend database in a project.
